Hey, Charlie ðŸ‘‹! Itâ€™s been a while since we studied at UCD math together! I hope that you are doing well after grad school. It would be fun to catch up with you at some point!
I wanted to connect you with my friend & one of our fellow UCD math grads, Yoni, because of your mutual interest in environmental science & agriculture and just being cool people. I think that you both would have a lot to talk about and be interested in each otherâ€™s perspective on things!

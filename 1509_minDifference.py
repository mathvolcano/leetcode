        # [1]. Sort the array
        # [2]. Track the min 4 elements and the max 4 elements and compute their min difference

        # means that we can choose values for them in the moves to set them to 0.

        # Base case â€“ can always change 3 numbers to the 4th, so the difference will be 0.
